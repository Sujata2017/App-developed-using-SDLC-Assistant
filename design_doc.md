### System Design Document for Tic Tac Toe Web Application

#### 1. Overview
This document outlines the design of a web-based Tic Tac Toe game application. The system will support both basic functionality and additional features to enhance the user experience. The application will be responsive and accessible across multiple devices.

#### 2. User Stories
The user stories provided in the prompt are the foundation for the system requirements. Each story will guide the design and development process to ensure a complete and functional application.

#### 3. System Architecture
The system will be designed using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to separate logic, user interface, and data management. The web application will be built using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with frameworks like React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. For the database, MongoDB will be used to store game history and other persistent data.

#### 4. Components and Modules

##### 4.1 Frontend
- **Main Game Display**: A 3x3 grid that represents the game board.
- **Player Selection UI**: A section where a player selects X or O.
- **Control Buttons**: "Start Game", "Play Again", and "Undo Last Move" buttons.
- **Notification Area**: Displays win, draw, or undo confirmation messages.
- **Game Settings Panel**: Allows players to adjust the game speed.
- **Game History Panel**: Shows a list of previous games.

##### 4.2 Backend
- **Game Logic Engine**: Manages game rules, turn switching, and win conditions.
- **User Authentication Service**: Handles user login and session management (optional, for tracking game history).
- **Database Interface**: Connects to MongoDB to save and retrieve game data.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides endpoints for the frontend to interact with the backend for game state and history.

#### 5. Data Flow
- The user interacts with the game via the frontend UI.
- The frontend sends requests (e.g., move selection, game reset) to the backend through API calls.
- The backend processes these requests, updates the game state, and sends the updated state back to the frontend.
- The frontend updates the UI to reflect the new game state.
- Game history and settings are stored in the database for future reference.

#### 6. Technologies and Tools
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **State Management**: Redux (optional, for state management in React)
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Flexbox/Grid
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for integration tests

#### 7. User Interface Design
- **Home Page**: Displays a welcome message and options to start a new game or view game history.
- **Game Page**: Main game area with the 3x3 grid, control buttons, and a sidebar for game settings and history.
- **Settings Page**: Allows users to configure game speed.
- **History Page**: Lists past games with options to review each game's details.

#### 8. Backend Services
- **Game Service**: Handles game logic and state management.
- **User Service** (if using user accounts): Manages user sessions and authentication.
- **Database Service**: Manages data persistence and retrieval.

#### 9. Database Schema
- **Games Collection**: Stores game states, including player symbols, move history, and outcome.
- **Users Collection** (if applicable): Stores user information for tracking game history.

#### 10. Security
- **Session Management**: Ensures user sessions are secure and valid.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database.

#### 11. Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure that different parts of the system work together correctly.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Validate that the game meets user requirements.

#### 12. Deployment
- The application will be deployed on a cloud service provider like AWS or Google Cloud.
- Use Docker for containerization to ensure a consistent environment across development, testing, and production.

#### 13. Maintenance and Support
- Regular updates to fix bugs and add new features based on user feedback.
- Continuous monitoring of the application for performance and stability issues.

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the development of a Tic Tac Toe web application, ensuring that the final product meets the specified requirements and enhances the user experience.
